# Welcome to Barcelona project!

Here you have a lot of information about our city. You have a lot of information, you should select only the most interesting, you don't want to consume all the memory in your computer!

## Project Goals

* Give some insights about your topic giving some arguments.
* Choose the data interesting for your questions. 
* Think about more data would be great to have.
* Propose a structure for the database (add the aggregates you think that will be useful). You don't need to give us a very detailed structure with the data types, only the tables you would create and some relations between them.
* You can't do any plot!!


## Some hints
* Propose some interesting questions you could answer with the data you have.
* Look for more interesting datasets you could use.
* Before starting doing a lot of code, think the way you are doing the analysis (workflow).
* You will see you have more questions than answers. Never mind. Even if you can't answer any question. Be sure you show us why you couldn't answer something and only that will be very interesting.
* You don't need to give us all the CREATE TABLE statements, only need to propose a structure. For example you could take a picture of your drawings.
* For the structure, if you have data with columns that don't match, feel free to add them and do some comments like you would need that columns.
* For the structure you can also delete the columns you think are useless.
* Follow the workflow you have defined. If you need to add a task don't worry but have it in mind.


## Topics 
* Transports.
* Urban environment.
* Population administration.
* Economy and business.

## At Friday you will be asked to...
* Present your insights and your arguments as easy for us as you can (with NO plots).
* Give importance to the most important questions (or you think that are the most interesting).
* Explain the questions you couldn't answer and why.
* Explain why you chose the data you chose.
* Explain how would you save the data: the structure, the data you would need to add, the data you would like to delete, etc.
* Explain the learnings with the workflow: if you could have done it better, if you have needed to add any task, if it's been useful, etc.

## First day instructions:

* Fork the repository.
* Take a look on the possible datasets you have (below the info).
* Do some brainstorming thinking some interesting questions you could do and which data you would use.
* Look for some more data [in Barcelona Open Data page](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/en) and [in Catalonia governement webpage](http://governobert.gencat.cat/es/dades_obertes/) and in [Spanish governement webpage](https://datos.gob.es/en).
* Define the tasks you will do, setting those ones to be done individually and those ones to be done pairing.


## About the presentation
* You will have ten minutes to do your presentation. Take at least 8 of the slides proposed.
* Send your slides to the TAs at least 30 minutes before the time of the presentation.
* We will spend 1 hour presenting approx, then 5 minutes to break and then have a short debate about the projects.


## Slides

* Title of the project
* Presentation of the team
* Your main challenges
* Your greatest strengths
* Your first experience with Kanban: did you follow always the methodology? did you need to add more tasks? advantages / disadvantages...
* About your data: useful sources you have used, data you have found but it is uncomplete, data that would have been great to have, etc
* About the data you decided to use: how you would save it (a photo of the structure proposed would be great, don't need to import the data or create the tables in the database), new data you would add (aggregates, etc)
* Your main insights
* Arguments for the insights (do some screenshots of the data)
* Questions you couldn't answer
* Something funny that happened during the project
* Learnings with this project
